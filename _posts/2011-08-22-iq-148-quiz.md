Supposedly, your IQ is 148+ if you get this right.

There are 4 prisoners waiting to get executed. Divided by a non-transparent wall, prisoners A, B, C, D are aligned and the executor put black and white hats on their heads as shown in the picture. Prisoners only know that there are 2 black hats and 2 white hats. Now, the executor is giving any of them a chance to guess their own hat&#8217;s color. If anyone can guess correctly, they all get freed, or they all die. Given that they can only see forward, they can&#8217;t see through the wall, and they have a single chance to guess, who can guess right?
