<p>Supposedly, your IQ is 148+ if you get this right.</p>

<p>There are 4 prisoners waiting to get executed. Divided by a non-transparent wall, prisoners A, B, C, D are aligned and the executor put black and white hats on their heads as shown in the picture. Prisoners only know that there are 2 black hats and 2 white hats. Now, the executor is giving any of them a chance to guess their own hat’s color. If anyone can guess correctly, they all get freed, or they all die. Given that they can only see forward, they can’t see through the wall, and they have a single chance to guess, who can guess right?</p>
