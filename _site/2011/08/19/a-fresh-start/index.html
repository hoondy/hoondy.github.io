<p>I am pleased to announce that newly revamped Hoondy.com is now up and running under a new web server.</p>

<p>It’s now fully integrated with Facebook, so whatever I write here will automatically get posted on my FB wall. How awesome is that?</p>

<p>Also, I made this site supported by Google AdSense. In internet universe, traffic equals money. I didn’t mean to make money off of a personal website, but it was rather a good exercise to utilize the most established monetizing platform in internet world and learn some cool technology.</p>

<p>I hope you to subscribe or check back this site periodically as I will post some useful tech/lifestyle/food/car/photography info. Adios!</p>
