# Donghoon Lee

I am a recent [Computational Biology & Bioinformatics](https://cbb.yale.edu) PhD graduate from Yale.

The title of my dissertation is "Leveraging Functional Genomic Data: Modeling Transcriptional Dynamics and Interpreting Disease Genomes."

My research is in the middle ground between *Functional Genomics* and *Data Science*. We are living in an interesting time where an unprecedented amount of data is generated in the field of biology, especially in genomics. I am interested in machine learning approaches (artificial neural network and dimensionality reduction) to tackle problems in genomics. My research experiences encompass integrative approaches in identifying cis-regulatory elements, annotating non-coding genome based on epigenomic profiling, and prioritizing variants related to RNA and cancer biology.
